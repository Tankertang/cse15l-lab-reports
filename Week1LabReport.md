After installing VScode we had to setup VScode to use Git Bash. Since I was using MacOS my VScode came with bash. After switching to bash on terminal we use the command `ssh cs15lwi23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu` to connect to CSE 15 account.
***
After Connectning we are greated with this line of code.
```
â¤‡ ssh cs15lwi23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu
The authenticity of host 'ieng6.ucsd.edu (128.54.70.227)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:ksruYwhnYH+sySHnHAtLUHngrPEyZTDl/1x99wUQcec.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?

Then we run some command such as 
* cd ~
* cd
* ls -lat
* ls -a
* ls <directory>
* cp /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lwi23/public/hello.txt ~/
* cat /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lwi23/public/hello.txt

To log out of the remote server in your terminal, you can use:
***
Ctrl-D or
Run the command `exit`

After finishing using the bash terminal, we made a GitHub account to documents are work projects using MarkDown. [Here is a list of common MarkDown References](https://ucsd-cse15l-w23.github.io/week/week1/). Here is the [Link](yessir.md) to the website I made.
